# Helpet Veterinary Clinic Website

## 🚀 Project Overview & Motivation
This repository contains a comprehensive web project developed over the course of a semester for the Web Technologies curriculum. It is a fully functional, multi-page website designed for a fictional veterinary clinic. The goal was to demonstrate knowledge of core frontend technologies by building a platform that is not only visually appealing but also robust and user-friendly.

## ✨ Features & Pages
This application features a variety of interactive elements and structured layouts:

* **Homepage**: A welcoming introduction to the clinic, featuring a small photo gallery.
* **Services Catalog**: A detailed breakdown of medical offerings (Laboratory, Surgery, Pediatrics, etc.). The layout is optimized using modern CSS techniques to present information clearly and attractively.
* **Emergency & Ambulance Unit**: A dedicated page for non-stop emergency services. This page features a custom miniature ambulance illustration crafted entirely using CSS.
* **Login Page**: A Login page that mimics backend communication. It utilizes JavaScript `(fetch)` to validate user credentials from a JSON file.
* **Interactive Appointment Form**: A contact interface allowing clients to request appointments online.
* **Responsive Design**: The site adapts to any screen size (desktop, tablet, or mobile phone).

 ## 🔧 Local Installation & Setup

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/georgiana-raluca-negru/Web-Technologies
    ```
2.  **Important Note**: This project uses the `fetch()` API to load login data from a JSON file. Therefore, the login functionality will not work if you simply double-click `index.html` to open it from your file explorer. You must run it through a local server.

3.  The easiest way to view the project is using the **Live Server** extension in Visual Studio Code:
    * Ensure the Live Server extension is installed.
    * Right-click on the `index.html` file in your Explorer sidebar.
    * Select **Open with Live Server**.
    * The project will launch automatically in your default browser with full functionality.
